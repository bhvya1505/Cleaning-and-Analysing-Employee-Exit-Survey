# Cleaning-and-Analysing-Employee-Exit-Survey
This project uses pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn.

In this project, we'll work with exit surveys from employees of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. You can find the TAFE exit survey and the survey for the DETE in the repository.

We try to find answers to the following questions:

- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
- Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?
- Are female employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about male employees?

The Jupyter Notebook file Basics.ipynb contains further description of the project along with the codes and their explanations.
